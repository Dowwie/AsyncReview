## Review Categories

Analyze the PR changes against these categories. Fetch the relevant checklist if you need detailed guidance:

1. **SOLID & Architecture** - Design principle violations, code smells
   - Fetch `checklists/solid-checklist.md` for detailed SOLID prompts
   
2. **Security & Reliability** - Vulnerabilities, auth gaps, race conditions
   - Fetch `checklists/security-checklist.md` for security patterns to check
   
3. **Code Quality** - Error handling, performance, boundary conditions
   - Fetch `checklists/code-quality-checklist.md` for quality patterns
   
4. **Removal Candidates** - Dead code, unused imports, deprecated patterns
   - Fetch `checklists/removal-plan.md` for removal planning template

## Instructions

1. First, understand the PR: read the diff, description, and any related files
2. Decide which categories are relevant based on the changes
3. Fetch checklists for relevant categories using `FETCH_FILE:checklists/<name>.md`

5. Classify each finding by severity (P0, P1, P2, P3)
6. Provide fix suggestions for P0 and P1 issues

## Severity Levels

- **P0 (Critical)**: Security vulnerability, data loss risk, correctness bug → MUST block merge
- **P1 (High)**: Logic error, significant SOLID violation, performance regression → Should fix before merge
- **P2 (Medium)**: Code smell, maintainability concern, minor SOLID violation → Fix in PR or follow-up
